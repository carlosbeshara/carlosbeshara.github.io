### CPSC 120 – My Favorite Labs

Lab 3 – Data Types and Input/Output
Lab 3 turned out to be one of those sessions where everything just started making sense in my head. Handling various data types such as integers, doubles, and strings really got me going.
it helped me understand how programs actually store and use information. I also liked seeing
how user input and output work together to make programs interactive. This lab
helped me to become comfortable with writing basic code and taught me how to avoid
simple yet significant mistakes, like using variables before initializing them.

Lab 5 – Blackjack Logic and Conditionals
What caught my attention was Lab 5 because, for the first time, we had to apply programming logic.

Improved the way I think through problems before writing code.
Lab 9 – Vector Processing and Patterns
One of my favorite labs was Lab 9 because it challenged me to work with larger sets.
of data in an organized way. Learning how to process vectors using common patterns
showed me how much cleaner and more efficient my code could be. This lab helped It helped me understand how important it is for structure, readability, and planning whenever working. we were working with collections of data, which felt like a big step forward from earlier labs.
